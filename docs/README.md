# GoPredict: Vehicle Resale Days-on-Market Prediction ðŸš—

## Description
**GoPredict** is a Machine Learning model designed to predict how many days a vehicle will stay on the market before being sold. It leverages features such as age, price, and mileage to help dealerships optimize inventory management and implement dynamic pricing strategies.

## Team Members

* ðŸ‘¤ Aquiles Escarra
* ðŸ‘¤ Angela Lekivetz
* ðŸ‘¤ Komaljeet Kaur
* ðŸ‘¤ Victoriia Biaragova

## Project Objectives

* Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and detect trends.
* Develop a regression model to predict days on the market.
* Optimize inventory management for dealerships.
* Visualize results using Power BI and an APP.

##  Dataset and Data Source

* **Source:** Dataset provided by Go Auto, one of the largest vehicle dealership networks in Canada.
* **Location:** Edmonton and surrounding areas.
* **Key Features:** Vehicle age, mileage, price, dealership location.

## Model and Technical Implementation

### Architecture
The final model employs a **Segmented Random Forest Regressor** to address non-linearities across different price points.

| Component | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Model Type** | Segmented Random Forest Regressor |
| **Segmentation** | 3 Tiers (Low, Medium, High) based on **MSRP** |
| **Feature Count** | **10 Selected Features** (including engineered features like `month_listed`, `discount`) |
| **Key Hyperparameters** | `n_estimators=350`, `max_depth=35`, `min_samples_split=5` |

### Technologies and Tools
* **Core:** Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
* **Analysis:** Jupyter Notebook
* **Version Control:** GitHub
* **Model Persistence:** `joblib`
* **Visualization:** Power BI
